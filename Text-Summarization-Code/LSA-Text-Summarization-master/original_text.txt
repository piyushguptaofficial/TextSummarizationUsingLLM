Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a sub-field of artificial intelligence (AI). It focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. The ultimate goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human languages. Applications of NLP include chatbots, sentiment analysis, and language translation. Recent advancements in NLP are largely driven by deep learning and large language models like GPT.
